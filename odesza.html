    <p>I found out about Odesza in January 2015. From the first time I heard their music I instantly fell in love. Do you ever listen to music and you get goose bumps and your hair raises because you love it so much? Or listen to a song that really just makes you think about life and makes you want do better? Odesza does it for me. Once I found them I instantly became in love (*cough* obsessed). Not only are they amazing to listen to recorded, but live is an unreal experience and I may or may have not been to pretty much all of their local shows in the PNW since I found them. From the art and the visuals to the drumline and other various live instruments and feeling of unity you feel with everyone in that crowded audiance. An Odesza show is like a beautiful breath of fresh are you didn't know you needed.  I have decided to make this page to work on box model and also show you some <i>incredible</i> music. </p>
